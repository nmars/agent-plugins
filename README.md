# Konflux Skills

Claude Code skills to help developers work with the [Konflux CI/CD platform](https://konflux-ci.dev).

## What Are These Skills?

Skills are reusable knowledge modules that Claude Code can automatically invoke to help you with Konflux-specific tasks. They provide quick reference materials, best practices, and patterns for common Konflux workflows.

## Available Skills

### investigating-failed-plrs

Investigate why a specific Konflux PipelineRun failed:

- Drill through PLR conditions, failed TaskRuns, pod status, and exit codes
- Automated error and timing analysis scripts via KubeArchive
- Detect known failure categories (ImagePull, OOM, EC assertion, Cancelled)
- Collect and cache artifacts for offline investigation

### investigating-slow-builds

Investigate why Konflux builds or pipeline runs are slow:

- Analyze kueue queue time, task durations, and scheduling delays
- Check tenant ResourceQuota pressure
- Query Prometheus for historical cluster and tenant metrics
- Identify bottlenecks (kueue throttling, MPC provisioning, image pulls)

### navigating-github-to-konflux-pipelines

Find Konflux pipeline information from GitHub PR or branch checks:

- Identify Konflux checks and filter out Prow/SonarCloud
- Extract PipelineRun URLs from build and integration test checks
- Parse URLs to get cluster, namespace, and PipelineRun names for kubectl debugging
- Navigate from GitHub UI to Konflux pipeline details

### understanding-konflux-resources

Quick reference for Konflux Custom Resources:

- Which resource to use for different tasks (Application, Component, Snapshot, etc.)
- Who creates each resource (user vs system)
- Where resources belong (tenant vs managed namespace)
- Common confusions about ReleasePlans, ReleasePlanAdmissions, and IntegrationTestScenarios

### working-with-provenance

Trace Konflux builds from container images back to source:

- Extract provenance attestations from container images
- Find build logs and PipelineRun details from image references
- Verify source commits for deployed containers
- Navigate from artifacts back to builds and source code

### konflux-architecture

Navigate the two canonical sources of Konflux design information (service specs, ADRs, user guides, API references) with a progressive discovery strategy for evaluating and critiquing feature proposals.

### using-trusted-maven-dependencies

Update a Maven project to use dependencies from a trusted repository:

- Replace Maven Central dependencies with security-patched rebuilds
- Add trusted repository configuration to `pom.xml` (`<repositories>` and `<pluginRepositories>`)
- Enforce semantic version equivalence (no upgrades or downgrades)
- Handle property-based versions by updating `<properties>` entries

### component-build-status

Trigger build of Konflux Component:

- Trigger build of a component
- Wait for release to finish
- Instruct Claude to perform nudging
- Get status of a Component or Application

### red-hat-konflux-teams

Map repositories to Red Hat engineering teams:

- Look up which team owns a given Konflux repo
- Find all repos owned by a specific team
- Identify unassociated repos across konflux-ci, hermetoproject, and conforma orgs
- Reference JIRA project keys and components per team

## Installation

First, add the konflux-skills marketplace (one-time setup):

```bash
claude
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/konflux-ci/skills.git
```

Then install individual skills:

```bash
claude
/plugin /install <skill-name>
```

## Usage

Once installed, Claude Code will automatically discover and use these skills when you ask Konflux-related questions. No special commands required - just ask naturally:

- "Which Konflux resource should I use to build a container from my Git repository?"
- "Where do I create a ReleasePlan in Konflux?"
- "How are Snapshots created in Konflux?"
